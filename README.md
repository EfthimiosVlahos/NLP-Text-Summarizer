Welcome to the NLP Text Summarization projectâ€”a testament to advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise. This comprehensive project is driven by sophisticated tools and scripts, including the influential Pegasus model. As you navigate through this endeavor, you'll explore its intricate components, highlighting my proficiency in machine learning and NLP. The project is structured around the following key elements:

## 1. Project Template Creation

- **GitHub Repository Setup:**
  - Create a dedicated GitHub repository for the project.

- **Directory Structure:**
  - Define a structured project directory hierarchy.
  - Include an `__init__.py` file for Python package/module compatibility.
  - List all necessary project files and their locations.

- **File Path Handling:**
  - Utilize the `Path` library for cross-OS compatible file paths.
  - Separate directory and file names with `os.path.split()`.

- **Automation:**
  - Use `os.makedirs()` to create folders and directories dynamically.

- **Logging Implementation:**
  - Implement a robust logging system with Python's `logging` module.
  - Verify file existence with `os.path.exists(filepath)` and retrieve file size with `os.path.getsize(filepath)`.
  - Properly manage project files with `with open(filepath, filename) as f`.


## 2. Logging and Utils

- **Custom Logging:**
  - Develop a custom logging system tailored for machine learning tasks.

- **Utility Functions (UTILS):**
  - Create utility functions in a separate 'UTILS' module to enhance code modularity and reusability.
  - Store commonly used functions for easy access.

- **Configuration Management:**
  - Utilize 'Configbox' for managing configurations efficiently.
  - Access configuration values using keys for convenience.


## 3. Entire Project Experiment

  - Conduct an in-depth Jupyter notebook experiment to provide a holistic understanding of the entire project.
  - Ideal for machine learning engineers seeking profound insights.

- **Hands-On Exploration:**
  - Gain practical experience by following step-by-step instructions within the experiment.
  - Navigate through project workflows and components to grasp the project's intricacies.


## 4. Project Workflows

- **Step-by-Step Guide:**
  - Access a comprehensive guide outlining step-by-step workflows for project execution.
  - Ensure a systematic approach from data ingestion to triumphant deployment.

## 5. Data Ingestion

- **Initial Data Preparation:**
  - Set up the data ingestion configuration.
  - Utilize 'params.yaml' and '@dataclass()' for structured data handling.

## 6. Data Validation

- **Exploration and Validation:**
  - Conduct data validation processes.
  - Emphasize data quality and integrity.

## 7. Data Transformation

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Cover crucial data preprocessing steps.
  - Highlight feature engineering and data preparation.

## 8. Training Pipeline

- **Model Training:**
  - Showcase model training using cutting-edge NLP techniques, including the Pegasus model.
  - A valuable resource for ML engineers aspiring to enhance their model development skills.

## 9. Prediction Pipeline and User App

- **Prediction Pipeline and User-Friendly App:**
  - Journey through the development of a prediction pipeline and a user-friendly summarization application.
  - Demonstrating the practical application of NLP models, including Pegasus, and bridging the gap between complex technology and end-users.

## 10. Final CI/CD Deployment on AWS

- **CI/CD Deployment on AWS:**
  - Culmination of the project's journey with seamless AWS deployment, incorporating CI/CD best practices.
  - Ideal for ML engineers with a vision for scaling and deploying models, including Pegasus, in production environments.
